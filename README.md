# Neural Network and Deep Learning - 1st Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the first assignment for NTU's SC4001/CZ4042/CE4042 course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The project focuses on working with tabular data, implementing neural networks using PyTorch Tabular, and evaluating regression models applied to real-world datasets.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes audio and HDB resale data with both numeric and categorical features such as:
- **Numeric Features**: chroma_stft_mean, rms_mean, Distance to nearest station, distance to Dhoby Ghaut, degree centrality, eigenvector centrality.
- **Categorical Features**: Month, town, flat model type, storey range.



## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and folders:
- `data&assignment.zip`: A zipped folder containing the dataset files, assignment description.
- `yawen_zhang_PartA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the neural network model.
- `yawen_zhang_PartB.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the neural network model.
